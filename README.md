# Seven_Segment_Display
Two-digit Seven Segment display designed using Verilog within Xilinx Vivado Design Suite and tested all possible outputs from 00 to 99 using BASYS3 Artix-7 FPGA Board.

SevenSegment design and constraint files embedded as a module to be used within the TwoDigit top-level project to correctly analyze inputs and produce the correct outputs from 00 to 99 using 6-bit input.
